alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"TCP Port Scan Detected"; flags:S;
threshold:type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 5; sid:1000002;

meaning of these:
1) alert =  it generate the alert when the packert has been arrived. if the given rules are the matches then and tthen it shows the alert;
2) tcp = it is protocol.
3) any any = it shows the source ip/address and port address... 
4) -> = it shoes the flow that how the packet has been sent sorce and destination.
5)$HOME_NET any =$HOME_NET → your  network (Ubuntu machine)
any → any destination port (22, 80, 443, etc.)
6)msg : this shows the message  when the packet has been detected
7)flges = it repersent the s= synchronize when the syn packet detected
8)threshold:type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 5
type both	Apply threshold to alerts and logs
track by_src	Track packets by source IP
count 10	Trigger alert after 10 SYN packets
seconds 5	Within 5 
1. What is IDS?

**IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** is a security system that **monitors network traffic** and **detects suspicious or malicious activities** and generates alerts.

2. Difference between IDS and IPS

| IDS                       | IPS                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Detects attacks           | Detects and blocks attacks     |
| Works in passive mode     | Works in active mode           |
| Generates alerts only     | Prevents attacks automatically |
| Example: Snort (IDS mode) | Example: Snort (IPS mode)      |

3. What is Snort= is an open-source Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS)used to analyze network traffic in real time and detect attacks using rules.

4. What is port scanning?

Port scanning is a technique used to check which ports are open, closed, or filtered on a target system to identify running services or vulnerabilities.

5. What is Nmap used for?

Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for:

 Port scanning
 Network discovery
 Identifying open ports and services
Security auditing


6. What is HOME_NET?

HOME_NET is a Snort variable that defines the internal or protected network IP range that Snort monitors for attacks.

ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
7. What is a Snort rule?

A **Snort rule** is a set of instructions that tells Snort **what traffic to detect and alert on, based on protocol, IP, port, and packet behavior.


8. What is SID in Snort?

SID (Snort ID) is a unique identifier assigned to each Snort rule to identify and manage rules.
User-defined rules use SID values ≥ 1000000.
